# Avni Website

A simple personal website consisting of a static `index.html`, `styles.css`, and `script.js`.

Overview
- A small, hand-crafted personal site with a single-page layout.
- Uses plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — no build step required.

Quick start
1. Clone the repository:

	git clone <your-repo-url>
2. Open the site locally by opening `index.html` in your browser, or serve it from a simple HTTP server:

	python3 -m http.server 8000

	Then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser.

Development
- Edit `index.html`, `styles.css`, and `script.js` to make changes.
- No package manager or tooling is required — just a text editor and a browser.
